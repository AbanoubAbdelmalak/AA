# The project visualization could be divided into two main windows

## Bakery and production visualization
* This window should contain a list of the current orders with their status.
* All the agents of the baking till transportation showing their current activities and their products available for the next stages.

## Transportation
* For the transportation their could be a graph for all the bakeries, customers and trucks updating their positions periodically.

# Potential libraries and frameworks

## __Abstract Window Toolkit(AWT)__
* The most primitive toolkit for simple windows creation and visualization with some basic fields that could be added.
* The main advantage of it is that there are so many examples and implementations using it. 

## Swing
* Swing is an extension of AWT toolkit.
* It is easier to use and contains more options than the AWT. 
* It also contains a class called JTable which is suitable to visualize this jade environment for different orders and agents.
* And for graphs there are also some implemented examples available online to help as a guidance for the transportation.
